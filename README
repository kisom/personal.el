[1]: An initial version is provided, but isn't tracked.

customisations:
        * use scpaste (a mode that allows the current buffer to be formatted
          and SCP'd to my paste server.)
        * set the PATH environment variable from my .zshrc when using
          shell-command-to-string
        * set the theme

cmus:
        The prefix keybinding for the cmus commands is 'C-c C-m'. The commands are
        
          x     play or pause cmus
          k     kill cmus (stop play)
          n     next track
          p     previous track
          s     show the currently playing track in the minibuffer
          h     toggle shuffle
          r     toggle repeat
          m     toggle the album, artist, all mode
